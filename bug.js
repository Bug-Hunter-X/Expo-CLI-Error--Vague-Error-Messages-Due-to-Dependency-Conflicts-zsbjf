This error occurs when using Expo CLI with a project that has a package.json file containing dependencies that conflict with each other or with the Expo managed workflow.  For example, using a native module that's not compatible with Expo's managed workflow, or having conflicting versions of React Native libraries.  The error message itself is often vague and can point to seemingly unrelated issues.
