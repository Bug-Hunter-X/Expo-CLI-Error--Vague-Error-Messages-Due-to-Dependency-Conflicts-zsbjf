The solution involves carefully examining the project's `package.json` and resolving any dependency conflicts or incompatibilities.  This might involve:

1. **Using `npm-check-updates` or `yarn upgrade-interactive`:** These tools help identify outdated or conflicting packages.
2. **Manually checking versions:** Compare the versions of your dependencies to ensure compatibility with each other and with Expo's current release.  The Expo documentation provides compatibility information for React Native.
3. **Resolving conflicts:** Upgrade or downgrade packages as needed to resolve conflicts.  If one package requires a specific version of another package, adjust accordingly.
4. **Removing or replacing incompatible native modules:**  If you're using a native module that's not compatible with Expo's managed workflow, consider either removing it or finding an Expo-compatible alternative.
5. **Cleaning up npm or yarn cache:** Running `npm cache clean --force` or `yarn cache clean` can sometimes resolve issues related to corrupted or stale cache data.

Here's a simplified example of how to resolve a dependency conflict in `package.json` (assuming a conflict between `react-native-maps` and `react-native`):

```json
// Correct package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native": "^0.71.8",
    "react-native-maps": "^1.3.2" // Ensure this version is compatible with your React Native version
  }
}
```

Remember to run `expo start` or `expo prebuild` after making changes to your `package.json`.
