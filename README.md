# Expo CLI Error: Vague Error Messages Due to Dependency Conflicts

This repository demonstrates a common yet frustrating issue encountered when using the Expo CLI: vague error messages arising from dependency conflicts or incompatible native modules within your project's `package.json`.

The error often lacks specific details, making it challenging to diagnose the root cause.  The provided `bug.js` shows a simplified example of such a scenario, and `bugSolution.js` presents a solution to resolve this type of issue.  The focus is on resolving conflicting versions of React Native dependencies and ensuring compatibility with Expo's managed workflow.

## Reproducing the Issue

The `bug.js` file illustrates a situation where conflicting dependencies might cause problems.  The steps to reproduce (though the specific conflict will vary based on your project's dependencies) generally include:

1.  Create a new Expo project.
2.  Manually add conflicting dependencies or native modules to `package.json`.
3.  Attempt to run the project using Expo CLI.  Observe the vague error message.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` provides a working example by resolving the dependencies and ensuring compatibility.  Common resolutions involve:

*   Carefully reviewing `package.json` for conflicting packages.
*   Checking version compatibility (using tools like `npm-check-updates` or similar).
*   Resolving conflicting versions by upgrading or downgrading packages.
*   Removing incompatible native modules or replacing them with Expo-compatible alternatives.
*   Using the Expo Go app which often can show a more verbose error message
